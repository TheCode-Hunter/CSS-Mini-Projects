# 🎨 CSS Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of frontend mini-projects built using **HTML** and **CSS**. Each project is created from scratch as part of my learning journey to improve layout design, styling skills, and responsive web development.

⚠️ Note: The projects are not responsive and are best viewed on a desktop screen.

⚠️ These projects are made for learning purposes only.
